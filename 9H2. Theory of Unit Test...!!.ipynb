    "\n",
    "Unit Testing is the first level of software testing where the smallest testable parts of a software are tested. This is used to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed.\n",
    "The unittest test framework is python’s xUnit style framework.\n",

    "Method:\n",

    "test fixture:\n",
    "    \n",
    "A test fixture is used as a baseline for running tests to ensure that there is a fixed environment in which tests are run so that results are repeatable.\n",
